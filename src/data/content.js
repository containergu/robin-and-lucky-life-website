    description: `Huge news in our house today: Robin learned how to ride a bike!
      After a few wobbly starts and a lot of cheering, something just clicked this afternoon at OES. Suddenly, the training wheels were gone, and Robin was pedaling—a little slow at first, then faster, then a full, triumphant lap!
      The smile was absolutely priceless. It was not just a bike ride; it was a pure moment of self-belief.
      So proud of my amazing, two-wheeled kid! Watch out, world, Robin is mobile! 🎉
      What adventure should we tackle next? `,
